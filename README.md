# 1bitvm.c - 1bitvm implemetation in C
This is an implemetation of the 1bit processor as described by [adimineman](https://github.com/adimineman).
Being that it's written in C, it performes about 232x better, and because of the lower level and lower overhead it provides better compatability with software written for the 1bit architecture.



## Installation
### Dependacies
This software only depens on the GNU C Library, GCC and GNU Make
### Building
    make

## Usage 
    ./1bitvm infile
### Options
All described options are settable in `config.h`
 - `USE_SIMD` - Improves performance by up to 2x on supported platforms (modern x86 CPUs)
 - `DEBUG` - Debugging is availiable through four debug levels
 - `LIMIT` - Maximum number of executed instructions, -1 to disable
 - `EXIT_ON_EOF` - If set, the vm exits imediately after EOF is input, if not set, the vm is allowed to continue - IN will always be 1
 - `STDIN_PROMPT` - if set, the vm will prompt the user with the character `>`, if not set, the character will not be shown
 - `STDIN_PROMPT_STREAM` - sets the stream to which the prompt character may be printed

### Return values
    0 - Exited by PC non increment - graceful
    1 - Execution limit reached
    2 - EOF on stdin
